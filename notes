pthread_t:
    pthread_t is a type similar to int and it's created when you define it, 
    not when you call pthread_create . 

    In the snippet: 
    pthread_t tid; 
    int x = pthread_create (&tid, blah, blah, blah);  //it's the first line that creates the variable,
     although it doesn't hold anything useful until the return from pthread_create

pthread_cond_t:
    condition variable : A condition (short for ``condition variable'') is a synchronization device 
    that allows threads to suspend execution and relinquish the processors
    until some predicate on shared data is satisfied. 
    he basic operations on conditions are: 
    signal the condition (when the predicate becomes true), and wait for the condition, 
    suspending the thread execution until another thread signals the condition
