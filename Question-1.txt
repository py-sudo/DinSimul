1.All pthread function calls start with pthread_ and concat with specific descriptive function name, 
such as pthread_create(),pthread_attr,pthread_mutex_,pthread_mutexattr_,pthread_cond_,pthread_condattr etc..
The information is found in pthreads manual page.

2.Joining method to solve synchronization proble with pthread_exit and pthread_join functions.Mutex and condition variables is another mechanisim for synchronization.
The information is found in pthreads manual page.

	
3.It can prevent potential problems: 
	1.If several threads are waiting for the same wake up signal, they will take turns acquiring the mutex, and any one of them can then modify the condition they all waited for.
	2.If the thread received the signal in error due to a program bug
	3.The Pthreads library is permitted to issue spurious wake ups to a waiting thread without violating the standard.
	The information is found in pthread_cond_wait manual page.

4. The thread waits for the condition variable should start its excution immidiately. The information is found in pthread_cond_wait manual page.

5. It will wait for the signal for the condition variable and wake up the thread for execution,then release the two mutexes. 
	The information is found in pthread_cond_wait manual page.
6. when a detached thread reaches the end of execution, its resources are automatically released to the system. 
	The information is found in pthread_detach manual page.
